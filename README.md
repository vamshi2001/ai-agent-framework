# AI Agent Framework

**AI Agent Framework** is a lightweight and extensible platform for building autonomous, goal-driven AI agents. Designed for developers and researchers, the framework provides the foundational building blocks to create intelligent agents that can reason, plan, act, and interact in dynamic environments.

## üéØ Purpose

The framework is built to enable the development of **modular AI agents** that can:

* Perceive and interpret their environment
* Reason over goals and knowledge
* Make decisions using rule-based or learning-based strategies
* Execute plans and adapt to changing scenarios
* Communicate with other agents or systems when needed

Whether you're simulating intelligent behavior, automating complex workflows, or experimenting with cognitive architectures, Krishna AI Agent Framework provides the tools you need.

## üîß Key Features

* **Modular Architecture**: Separate components for perception, reasoning, planning, and execution.
* **Pluggable Behavior Models**: Support for custom logic or integration with AI/ML models.
* **Goal-Oriented Design**: Agents operate with explicit goals and can replan when conditions change.
* **Flexible Communication**: Message-passing support for multi-agent interactions or external system integration.
* **Built for Extensibility**: Easily extend components or define new agent types with minimal boilerplate.

## üß± Ideal Use Cases

* Simulation of intelligent decision-making systems
* Cognitive modeling and behavior-based research
* Autonomous task execution in enterprise or IoT systems
* Multi-agent collaboration scenarios

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* Java-based core (Spring-compatible where needed)
* Optional integrations with rule engines, knowledge graphs, or ML components
* Clean separation of agent lifecycle stages (initialization, goal evaluation, action execution)
