/**
 * Defines operations for synchronizing cache data with an underlying
 * persistent or distributed cache source in the AI-Agent Execution & Orchestration Platform.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This interface separates the responsibilities of the low-level cache
 * synchronization logic from the business-level cache usage represented by
 * {@link Cache}. It is primarily used to handle interaction with the actual
 * cache backend or external cache servers (e.g., Redis, NoSQL, distributed caches).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface are responsible for:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Loading data from the source cache system into memory.</li>
 *   <li>Writing updates back to the source cache or persistent store.</li>
 *   <li>Refreshing cached data based on configurable policies or triggers.</li>
 *   <li>Clearing or resetting cache content when required.</li>
 *   <li>Maintaining timestamps for the last refresh to optimize sync frequency.</li>
 *   <li>Notifying handlers about changes to specific cache keys.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Within the AI-agent framework, the cache synchronization mechanism ensures
 * that agent environment states, histories, and variables remain consistent
 * and performant across multiple distributed components or instances.
 * </p>
 * 
 * @param <K> the type of keys maintained by this cache operation
 * @param <V> the type of mapped values
