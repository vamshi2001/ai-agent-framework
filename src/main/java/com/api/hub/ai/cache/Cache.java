/**
 * Cache interface designed for fast in-memory access and modular extension
 * within the Enterprise AI Agent Execution and Orchestration Platform.
 * <p>
 * This interface provides basic cache operations and acts as the primary
 * abstraction used by agent-level or environment-level logic to store,
 * retrieve, and manage cached data.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface are typically backed by an in-memory
 * store (e.g., {@code HashMap}) for fast read/write access, and optionally
 * support syncing with an external cache source such as Redis, NoSQL stores,
 * or file systems via {@link CacheOperations}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This design is crucial for maintaining isolated and efficient state management
 * across multiple AI agents or chat sessions in a scalable, multi-tenant system.
 * </p>
